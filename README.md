# **Quark Matter Equation of State (EoS) Inside a Neutron Star**

This thesis was carried out under the supervision of **Prof. S. Somorendro Singh** in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of **Master of Science in Physics** at the **Department of Physics and Astrophysics, University of Delhi**.

## **Introduction**

Quark matter inside the cores of neutron stars exists as a **quark-gluon plasma**. This study investigates the Equation of State (EoS) of such matter using the **Density Dependent Quark Mass (DDQM) Model**, an extension of the **MIT Bag Model**, to better understand the internal structure and behavior of neutron stars.

## **Objectives**

- Compute EoS parameters using numerical methods  
- Evaluate thermodynamic quantities:  
  - Pressure  
  - Energy density  
  - Entropy  
  - Specific heat  
  - Speed of sound  
- Use **Gauss-Legendre Quadrature** for numerical integration  
- Use the **Central Difference Method** for numerical differentiation  
- Compare results with lattice QCD data and curvature data

## **Prerequisites**

To run this project locally, ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy astropy
```

# Usage
Clone this repository and open the Jupyter notebook named `Dissertation-.ipynb`. Run the notebook cells in sequence to follow the full data analysis and visualization pipeline.

# Future Work
- Incorporate deep learning models to compute key thermodynamic quantities such as:
  - **Number density**
  - **Quark number susceptibility**
  - **Taylor expansion coefficients** of the Gibbs potential
- Extend the DDQM model by including **temperature dependence** in addition to density.
- Compute **radial oscillations** of neutron star to understand their stability.

  
# Future Work Updates
July 15- Successfully produced the thermodynamic computations using the **TensorFlow** framework for improved numerical performance.
